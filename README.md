# ACCOUNTINGDATALAKEHOUSE
Applying Modern Data Stack to Build a Data Lakehouse for Accounting Analytics

This project builds a data lakehouse for accounting data processing and analysis, addressing the limitations of traditional data warehouses and data lakes. It ensures scalability, cost efficiency, and flexibility while maintaining data consistency and reliability.
The solution follows a three-layer Medallion architecture: raw data is imported into MySQL, transformed into Parquet, and stored in MinIO. Using Spark, data is cleaned in the silver layer and further processed into a star schema for accurate financial reporting. Dagster manages and monitors data pipelines, ensuring data integrity and automation.
With Power BI and Metabase, financial data is visualized effectively, enabling real-time insights and better decision-making. The entire system is containerized with Docker, ensuring scalability, portability, and ease of deployment.
This lakehouse approach is essential for accounting data as it handles large volumes efficiently, improves data governance, supports complex analytics, and ensures compliance with financial regulations, making financial reporting more accurate, automated, and insightful.

**Bronze Layer (Raw Data):** Stores data in its original format, ensuring a single source of truth and enabling easy auditing and reprocessing when needed.
**Silver Layer (Cleansed Data):** Uses Spark for data cleaning, filtering, and deduplication, improving data consistency and reliability.
**Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data):** Transforms data into a star schema tailored for accounting and financial reporting, ensuring accurate and structured insights.

# Conclusion
1. Achievements
I have successfully developed a Data Lakehouse (DLH) system based on the Modern Data Stack (MDS) model to support financial reporting and analysis in accounting. This project integrates the strengths of both Data Lake and Data Warehouse, overcoming the limitations of traditional models. The system is flexible, scalable, and provides superior functionality compared to conventional solutions. By utilizing technologies like MySQL, Minio, Hive, Docker, Dagster, Spark, and PowerBI, I built a platform that efficiently handles, processes, and visualizes accounting data, enabling better financial decision-making. The Modern Data Stack approach has proven to be more cost-effective and enhances both productivity and work efficiency. This project not only expanded my understanding of data processing but also deepened my knowledge of accounting processes, allowing me to leverage data-driven decision-making.
2. Limitations
The project currently uses academic-level tools, and advanced solutions that require licensing costs have not been integrated, limiting comprehensive comparisons with industry alternatives. Although based on MDS, the system has yet to fully capitalize on the potential of these technologies, with some features still in development. The system also does not yet support the processing of semi-structured and unstructured data. Moreover, the accounting processes have not been fully addressed, and further development is needed to enhance the solution. The absence of machine learning and AI integration limits the systemâ€™s automation and optimization capabilities.
3. Future Development
Develop tools for in-depth accounting data analysis.
Assess the solutionâ€™s effectiveness and refine the reporting features.
Make the application more user-friendly for non-technical users.
Implement exchange rate prediction models to forecast market trends.
